🎵 ADD YOUR BACKGROUND MUSIC HERE 🎵

Browsers BLOCK loading audio from external sites (CORS). You must
put the MP3 file in this folder for the music to work.

==================================================
YOUR TRACK: "Let Me Follow"
==================================================

1. Open this link in your browser:
   https://uupload.ir/view/let_me_follow_spotdown.org_3vef.mp3/

2. On that page, click the DOWNLOAD link (e.g. "دریافت لینک دانلود"
   or "Get download link") and download the MP3 file.

3. Rename the downloaded file to exactly: background.mp3

4. Put background.mp3 in THIS folder:
   assets/music/

5. Refresh your website. Click the ♪ button – music will play.

==================================================
WHY THE URL DIDN'T WORK
==================================================

The direct URL to the MP3 cannot be used in the <audio> tag because:
• The server (uupload.ir) does not send CORS headers
• Browsers block this as "OpaqueResponseBlocking"
• So the file must be downloaded and served from your own site

==================================================

STEP 3: Add to Your Website
